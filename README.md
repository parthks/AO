# Public Infrastructure Monitoring App

Empowering citizens to document and report the state of their local infrastructure using the Arweave blockchain to cause real change.

## Introduction

Welcome to the Public Infrastructure Monitoring App. This application enables citizens to capture and upload images of local infrastructure, storing the data on the Arweave blockchain. By leveraging blockchain technology, we ensure that all reports are immutable and accessible, promoting transparency and accountability in public infrastructure maintenance.

## Features

- **Photo Documentation**: Easily snap a picture of any infrastructure issue and upload it.
- **Blockchain Storage**: All data is securely stored on the Arweave blockchain, ensuring its permanence and integrity.
- **Automatic Location Tagging**: The location metadata from your photo is automatically used to tag the report.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **ArConnect Wallet**: Ensure you have the ArConnect wallet installed on your browser to interact with the Arweave blockchain.

### Steps to Use

1. **Capture the Issue**: Use your smartphone to take a clear photo of the infrastructure issue.
2. **Transfer the Image**: Due to current Google Sign In limitations, you need to transfer the image from your phone to your laptop.
3. **Connect Wallet**: Open the app on your laptop and connect using the ArConnect wallet.
4. **Upload the Image**: Simply upload the image. The app will automatically extract the location metadata and store the data on the Arweave blockchain.

## Known Issues

- **Google Sign-In**: The OAuth Google sign-in feature using Othnet is currently not working. You will need to transfer images from your phone to your laptop to use the app.
